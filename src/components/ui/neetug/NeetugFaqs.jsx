      question: "What is NEET UG counselling?",
      answer:
        "NEET UG counselling is the seat allotment process after NEET UG results. It determines which college and course (MBBS/BDS/AYUSH) you get based on your rank, category, and choice preferences. It's conducted at both national level (MCC for AIQ and Deemed/Central) and state level.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the difference between AIQ and State Quota?",
      answer:
        "All India Quota (AIQ) covers 15% of Government college seats and 100% of Deemed/Central university seats - conducted by MCC. State Quota covers the remaining 85% of Government college seats and is conducted by individual state counselling authorities. You can participate in both simultaneously.",
    },
    {
      question: "How many rounds does NEET UG counselling have?",
      answer:
        "MCC conducts Round 1, Round 2, Round 3, and a Stray Vacancy Round for AIQ seats. State counselling has its own rounds (varies by state - typically 2–4 rounds plus a mop-up round). Believers Consultancy tracks all rounds in real time.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "Can I participate in both AIQ and State Quota counselling simultaneously?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Eligible candidates can register for both MCC (AIQ) and their respective state counselling at the same time. You need to register and pay the registration fee separately for each.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is Believers Consultancy free for NEET UG data?",
      answer:
        "Yes! All NEET UG data - cut-offs, seat matrices, allotments, college profiles, fee data, and choice list tools - are completely free. Just create an account and access everything without any payment.",
