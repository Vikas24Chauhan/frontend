Candidates who successfully registered could edit their application details during the correction window, while the Selective Edit Window for correcting deficient photographs, signatures, and thumb impressions is open from 31 July to 10 August 2026 for eligible candidates notified by NBEMS.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I apply for NEET PG 2026?",
      answer:
        "You can apply online through the official NBEMS website. Register with your basic details, complete the application form, upload the required documents, pay the application fee, and submit the form. Before final submission, review all the information carefully to avoid errors.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "What documents should I keep ready before filling out the application form?",
      answer:
        "Keep your recent passport-size photograph, signature, MBBS qualification details, internship completion information, medical registration certificate, and a valid government-issued ID proof ready. Having these documents prepared in advance makes the registration process faster and smoother.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "What are the photo and signature guidelines for NEET PG registration?",
      answer:
        "Your photograph and signature must meet the specifications mentioned in the official NBEMS information bulletin, including the required dimensions, file size, and format. Uploading images that do not meet these guidelines may lead to rejection of your application.",
    },
    {
      question: "What should I do if my photo or signature is rejected?",
      answer:
        "If your uploaded image does not meet the prescribed specifications, NBEMS generally provides a correction window where eligible candidates can upload a fresh photograph or signature. Always follow the official image guidelines while re-uploading your documents.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "Can I correct mistakes after submitting the NEET PG application form?",
      answer:
        "Yes. NBEMS usually opens an application correction window after the registration period ends. During this period, candidates can edit certain details as permitted by the board. It is still advisable to verify all information carefully before submitting the application.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "Which details usually cannot be changed during the correction window?",
      answer:
        "Some personal details, such as your name, registered email ID, mobile number, nationality, and other key information, may not be editable after submission. Since editable fields can vary each year, always refer to the latest NBEMS notification for confirmation.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "What should I do if my payment fails but the amount is deducted?",
      answer:
        "If the payment amount is deducted but your application is not updated, wait for the payment status to refresh. In most cases, the amount is either adjusted or refunded automatically. If the issue persists, contact NBEMS through the official helpdesk before attempting another payment.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "How can I confirm that my NEET PG application has been submitted successfully?",

    },
    {
      question: "What if I forget my NEET PG application number?",
      answer:
        'If you misplace your application number, you can retrieve it using the "Forgot Application Number" option available on the official login page. You may need your registered email ID, mobile number, or other details to recover your account.',
    },
    {
      question: "Is it better to apply early or wait until the last date?",
      answer:
        "It is always recommended to apply as early as possible. Early registration helps you avoid last-minute technical issues, gives you enough time to review your application, and reduces the chances of making errors during the submission process.",
    },
    {
      question: "When will the NEET PG 2026 admit card be released?",

    {
      question: "Which documents should I carry to the NEET PG exam centre?",
      answer:

      question:
        "Can I change my NEET PG exam centre after submitting the application?",
